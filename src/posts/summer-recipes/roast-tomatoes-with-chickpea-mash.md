For the tomatoes:
- tomatoes 1 kg
- garlic 3 plump cloves
- olive oil 4 tbsp
- red wine vinegar 2 tbsp

For the chickpeas:
- chickpeas 3 x 400g cans
- 2 bay leaves
- thyme leaves
- olive oil 175ml
- chickpea cooking water 100ml
- lemons 2

Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Remove the stems from the tomatoes, slice each one in half and place them cut side up in a roasting tin. Put the garlic, unpeeled, among the tomatoes. Trickle the oil over them, season with salt and black pepper and toss gently to cover the tomatoes and garlic with the oil and seasoning.

Roast the tomatoes for 40 minutes until they have started to colour and they are surrounded by their juices. Remove the cloves of garlic and peel them. Sprinkle the red wine vinegar over the tomatoes and return to the oven for 5 minutes.

While the tomatoes are roasting, drain the chickpeas and tip them into a pan, pour over enough water to cover them, then add the bay leaves, thyme leaves and bring to the boil. Let them cook for 10 minutes until thoroughly hot.

Drain the chickpeas, reserving 100ml of cooking water, remove the bay leaves and put them in the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth, pouring in the oil in a steady stream, followed by the reserved chickpea water. Check the seasoning, adding more salt or black pepper as you think fit. Squeeze in enough of the lemon juice to give it a light, citrus kick (about 4-5 tbsp is my suggestion).

Spoon the chickpea purée on to a serving dish, then remove the tomatoes from the oven, place them on the purée and spoon over the juices.
