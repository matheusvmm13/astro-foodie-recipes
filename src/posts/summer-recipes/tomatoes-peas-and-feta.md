A simple salad, but wonderful with its salty cheese and verdant green dressing, this could take a few jagged croutons of torn ciabatta, fried crisp in olive oil, or be piled on bruschetta. The tomatoes must be joyous – ripe and peppery and warm from the sun.

Serves 2

- lemon half
- olive oil 6 tbsp
- mint leaves 8
- parsley leaves a large handful
- feta 100g
- tomatoes 4, medium
- peas 200g (shelled weight)
- cucumber 130g
- basil leaves 10

Squeeze the juice from the lemon into a blender jug. Add the olive oil, mint leaves and parsley, then season with a little salt and process to a thick, green dressing. Pour into a mixing bowl, then add the feta, crumbling it into small pieces with your fingers, then toss together gently and set aside.

Put a medium-sized pan of water on to boil. Slice the tomatoes thinly – about as thick as a £1 coin – then lay them, slightly overlapping, on a large plate. Season with ground black pepper. When the water is boiling, tip in the peas and let them cook for 3 or 4 minutes until tender, then drain and cool under running water.

Peel, seed and finely dice the cucumber and add to the feta. Shred and add the basil. Scatter the peas over the sliced tomatoes, then spoon over the feta and herb dressing and serve.
