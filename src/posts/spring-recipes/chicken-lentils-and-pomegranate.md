Small brown or green lentils are an earthy addition to this jumble of herbs, rice, nuts and fruit. There is a pleasing contrast of textures here: the mixture of white rice and brown lentils; the pomegranate for its pop of acidity; the toasted nuts offer a welcome crunch. I eat this warm rather than hot or cold, as a dish in its own right, though it would be welcome as an accompaniment too.

Serves 4

- leftover roast chicken 400g
- green or brown lentils 150g
- onion 1 medium
- olive oil 2 tbsp
- garlic 2 cloves
- basmati rice 250g
- chicken stock 500ml
- orange 1
- lemon 1
- pomegranate 1
- flaked almonds 20g
- coriander leaves 3 tbsp
- mint leaves 3 tbsp

Get the roast chicken out of the fridge – you don’t want it to be cold. Cook the lentils in deep, boiling water, lightly salted, for about 20 minutes till nutty and tender. Test their progress from time to time, then drain them and set aside.

Peel and finely chop the onion. Warm the oil in a deep saucepan, then add the onion and let it cook for 6-10 minutes or so, until translucent, stirring regularly. Peel and finely chop the garlic, then stir into the onion and continue cooking for a couple of minutes.

Wash the rice three times in a bowl of water, tipping away the cloudy water each time. Stir the rice into the pan, pour in the stock, cover with a lid and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and cook for 10 minutes.

Finely grate the zest from the orange and lemon, and remove the seeds from the pomegranate (you need about 200g). In a shallow pan over a moderate heat, toast the flaked almonds till golden. Tear the chicken into large pieces.

When the rice is ready, stir in the zests, almonds and the pomegranate seeds, the pieces of chicken and the herbs. Season with plenty of salt, black pepper and the juice of half of the lemon.
