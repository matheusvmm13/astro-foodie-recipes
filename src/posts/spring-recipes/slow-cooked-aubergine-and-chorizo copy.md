This is a good-natured dish that will keep for a day or two. You could also use it as the filling for a savoury crumble, with a crust of breadcrumbs or flour, butter and crumbled feta. It is a dish to take your time over, letting the aubergine soften to the point where you could cut it with a spoon.

Serves 4

- olive oil 2 tbsp
- cooking chorizo 250g
- red onion 1
- soft, dried prunes 150g
- aubergine 500g
- ground cumin 1 tsp
- ground coriander 1 tsp
- chicken stock 500ml

To finish:
- orange grated zest of 1
- mint leaves 10
- coriander leaves a handful

Warm the olive oil in a deep saucepan, break the chorizo into short pieces and add them to the oil. Let the chorizo cook for 3 or 4 minutes until its torn edges start to turn golden. Peel and roughly chop the onion, add to the pan and continue cooking until the onion is soft and translucent. Stir in the prunes.

Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Halve the aubergine lengthways, cut into thick slices and then into small cubes. Add to the pan and continue cooking until soft and tender. Stir in the cumin and coriander and let it cook for a minute or so, then pour in the chicken stock, add salt and black pepper and cover the dish with a lid. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes until all is meltingly soft.

Finely grate the orange zest, chop the herbs, then mix them together. Scatter over the stew as you ladle it into bowls.
