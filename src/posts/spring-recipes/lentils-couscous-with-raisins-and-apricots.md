- puy lentils 125g
- couscous 75g
- dried apricots 50g
- raisins 100g
- pine kernels 50g
- lemon juice 2 tsp
- olive oil 2 tbsp

Put 125g of small green lentils, such as le Puy, to cook in deep, unsalted boiling water. As they come to the boil, lower the heat so that they cook at an enthusiastic simmer for about 20 minutes. They should be tender but still retain a bit of bite. Put 75g of couscous into a bowl and pour over just enough stock to cover it. Set aside for a good 10 minutes until the stock has been fully absorbed.

Thinly slice 50g of dried apricots, then toss them into a bowl with 100g of raisins. Chop a handful of dill fronds and add them to the apricots and raisins. Lightly toast 50g of pine kernels in a shallow pan then, as they turn golden brown, tip them out and roughly chop them. Stir them into the apricots.

Make a simple dressing with 2 tsp of lemon juice, 2 tbsp of olive oil, a dash of walnut oil and some salt and pepper.

Drain the lentils, mix them with the dressing, then add to the couscous using a fork and toss lightly with the dried-fruit mixture. Serve warm or at room temperature.

**The trick**

Small, dark lentils need constant checking during cooking. They are probably best with a little bite left in them. I find they are generally perfect after about 15-18 minutes, but the exact time will vary according to the age of the lentils.

**The twist**

For a more substantial version use brown basmati rice instead of the couscous. Change the raisins for dried cherries or cranberries and swap the apricots for dried figs. A little pomegranate molasses can be added to the dressing in place of the lemon juice. You could leave the walnut oil out altogether or use hazelnut oil if you prefer.
