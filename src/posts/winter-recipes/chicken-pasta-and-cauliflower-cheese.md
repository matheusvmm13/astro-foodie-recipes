- rosemary sprigs 4
- black peppercorns 8
- olive oil 4 tbsp
- chicken thighs 1 kg
- pasta enough for 4, such as fusilli or trofie
- tarragon 7g
- parsley 10g
- lemon 1
- pine kernels 75g
- double cream 500ml

Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Pull the leaves from the rosemary then put them in a mortar with the black peppercorns and 1 tsp of sea salt. Grind to a coarse powder then blend in the olive oil.

Put the chicken, skin side down, in a roasting tin, pour over the herbed oil and turn to evenly coat. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes until the skin is crisp and golden.

Bring a deep pan of water to the boil and salt it generously. Remove the chicken from the oven and leave it to rest for 10 minutes, then remove the meat from the bones. Take care to preserve as many of the juices as possible. Tear the chicken into large pieces.


Cook the pasta in the boiling water for about 9 minutes. While it’s cooking, pull the tarragon and parsley leaves from their stems and roughly chop. Finely grate the lemon rind and add to the herbs. Toast the pine kernels in a shallow pan for a few minutes until golden then toss them in, too.

Drain the pasta. Place the roasting tin over a moderate heat and pour in the double cream, stirring to dissolve any caramelised roasting juices. Add the chicken and pasta, transfer to a warm serving dish, scatter over the tarragon crumbs and serve.
