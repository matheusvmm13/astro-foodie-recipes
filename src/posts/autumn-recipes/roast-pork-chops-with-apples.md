A spare rib chop, with or without the bone, pot roasts sweetly with a glass or two of apple juice, and some autumnal root vegetables. Don’t be tied to my suggestion of vegetables. If you are troubled by Jerusalem artichokes, then use small, yellow-fleshed potatoes or peeled and roughly chopped swedes, which are always happy with pork and apples. Serves 2

- butter 40g
- olive oil 3 tbsp
- spare rib chops 2 pieces/600g
- Jerusalem artichokes 400g
- lemon juice a little
- apples 500g
- garlic 3 cloves
- cider vinegar 3 tbsp
- apple juice 100ml

Warm the butter and olive oil in a large casserole to which you have a lid, season the chops with salt and black pepper then brown them lightly on both sides in the hot oil. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.

Peel the Jerusalem artichokes and rub them with lemon juice to stop them discolouring. Transfer the nicely golden chops to a plate and set aside. Put the artichokes into the pan and colour them lightly all over. Cut the apples into quarters, remove their cores, then cut into thick segments.

Add the apples to the pan and allow to turn golden on both sides, taking care not to overcook them. Peel the garlic and add it, whole, to the pan. Pour in the vinegar and let it sizzle, scraping at any crusted deposits on the pan with a wooden spoon. Pour in the apple juice, then place the pork on top of the artichokes and apples and cover with a lid.


Bake for an hour until the pork and artichokes are tender. Serve the chops with the artichokes and apples, checking the liquor for seasoning and spooning it over the chops.
