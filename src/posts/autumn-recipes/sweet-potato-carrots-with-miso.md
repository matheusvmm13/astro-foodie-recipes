The sweetness of carrots can take the intense savoury hit of a dark brown miso paste. I sweeten the miso with honey and stir in a little mustard, too, making a dressing that can be used to baste the carrots as they roast. This was intended as a side dish, but I have been eating it as a main course. Keep an eye on the carrots towards the end of cooking – you want them sticky and caramelised. (I recommend a non-stick roasting tin.)

- sweet potato 500g
- carrots 500g
- olive oil 3 tbsp
- brown miso 90g
- mirin 75ml
- honey 3tbsp
- grain mustard 1 tbsp
- sherry 80ml

Preheat the oven to gas mark 6/180C fan. Peel the sweet potatoes. Scrub the carrots. Cut the sweet potatoes into large chunks, about the size you would for roast potatoes, then cut the carrots in half lengthways (and in half again, if they are particularly large).

In a roasting tin, heat the olive oil over a moderate heat then add the sweet potatoes and carrots and let them brown lightly on the underside, then turn and lightly brown the others. Transfer the roasting tin to the oven and leave for about 40 minutes till the vegetables are tender to the point of a knife.

Meanwhile, put the brown miso in a small saucepan, add the mirin, honey, mustard and sherry and bring to the boil, stirring as the mixture warms. Remove from the heat. Remove the vegetables from the oven and pour over the sauce, making sure the sweet potatoes and carrots are lightly covered. Return to the oven for 15 minutes until the sauce is bubbling and caramelised.

Serve with steamed brown rice.
