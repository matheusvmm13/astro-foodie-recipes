The sweetness of carrots can take the intense savoury hit of a dark brown miso paste. I sweeten the miso with honey and stir in a little mustard, too, making a dressing that can be used to baste the carrots as they roast. This was intended as a side dish, but I have been eating it as a main course. Keep an eye on the carrots towards the end of cooking – you want them sticky and caramelised. (I recommend a non-stick roasting tin.)

- Serves 2
- parmesan 200g
- cauliflower 1 medium
- butter 30g
- olive oil 3 tbsp
- orecchiette 200g
- double cream 250ml
- dill fronds 10g

Put a deep pan of water on to boil and salt it generously. Finely grate the parmesan. Cut the cauliflower florets from the main stalk.

Warm the butter and oil together in a shallow pan, then fry the cauliflower florets for five minutes or so until lightly crisp and golden. Put the orecchiette into the boiling water and cook for about nine minutes or until tender.

Pour the cream into the cauliflower, add the grated parmesan and lower the heat. Drain the pasta and add it to the cauliflower and cream. Season with black pepper. Chop the dill fronds, stir into the pasta and serve.

 Broccoli, brussels tops, brussels sprouts and kale are all perfectly acceptable in place of the cauliflower. The pasta is interchangeable too, but it’s worth choosing one that will hold a little puddle of sauce, such as casarecce, anelli, cavatelli or ditalini.
